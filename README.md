# My Tennis Blog App

  

This project was created for fun and to practice new technologies.
This project uses React, Node.js and MySQL.

  

## How to run the project
In the project directory, there are two folders:
1. **api**- the bachend side is handled here, we'll need to run the server.
2. **client**- the frontend side is handled here, we'll need to run it as well.

### When running the App for the first time, we'll need to install the relevant packages on each side:
-` path-to-TennisBlogApp\api npm install`
and 
-` path-to-TennisBlogApp\client npm install`

---
### In order to run each side:
-` path-to-TennisBlogApp\api npm start`
and
-` path-to-TennisBlogApp\client npm start`
